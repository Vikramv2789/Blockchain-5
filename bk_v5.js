// Reflection
// What have you learned about the blockchain mechanism during the process of extending our simulated chain in part 5? Did you expect this when we started the part 1 of our chain? How has your knowledge on blockchain has evolved during our lessons and programming the simulated simplified chain?
// At first, the blockchain project seemed a little bit confusing. However, around blockchain 2, I felt like I began to get the hang of it. 

// What went well and what didnâ€™t go as expected?
// What went well was implementing my own implementations to the code. What didn't go as expected was doing the testing and the debugging since it was tedioius.

// How did you extend the program using the creative spinning wheel part? 
// I did not extend the program.

// What open ended question(s) do you have now? 
// A question I have is if this entire project is most of the implementation of the blockchain, or are there other essential aspects that were not included.

// Rate the difficulty of the project ( including all concepts and code) overall from 1 ( very easy) to 5 ( very difficult) 
// I would give this project a 3 because once the code was figured out, the rest was not bad.
